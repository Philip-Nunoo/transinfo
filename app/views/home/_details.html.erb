	<h3>How it works:</h3>

	<p>
		TrafficSense generates its superior accuracy by taking the huge amount of data points generated by the cellular network, and assigning each data point an accuracy which is similar to GPS. In order to achieve that – the system maps the cellular signaling patterns on the road, and preparing from it a reference location database (instead of the cellular tower location). The process includes recording physical drives over the roads, in which each cellular signaling message is recorded with a GPS location reference. Once this location reference database is ready, the system will use it as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
		The system tracks each specific anonymous vehicle, and by using a sequence of cellular messages the mobile phone generates, TrafficSense correlates it to the exact road it is traveling on. TrafficSense can’t distinguish between different lanes, but has the ability to distinguish between parallel, close-by roads and lanes which are separated by some type of terrain
		Once a vehicle is correlated to a road, the system can measure the position of the vehicle accurately, similar to a virtual sensor every 250 meters (in urban areas) along the road, while tracking the same vehicle as it passes every virtual sensor
		Every couple of location points provides an accurate travel time sample for that section. The system collects all the samples to continuously create a full traffic data picture for the monitored road
		A special algorithm is used to derive slowdown alerts from that flow data
	</p>

	<h3>Other Potential Contribution of TrafficSense:</h3>

	<p>

		Gathering traffic data from TrafficSense can be used for several other purposes:

		Road planning: Historical database of speed and volume estimations, continuous over weeks, months and years, as well as and origin destination statistics.

		Total delays analysis per section and for the entire road network. This is used by transportation agencies as a tool to evaluate their performance and measure improvements.
